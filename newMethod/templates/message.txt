Welcome!

This script aims to facilitate the implementation
of new methods in the Unsupervised Distance Learning Framework (UDLF).

We appreciate and thank you for the interest in our project!

---------

WARNING:

Before implementating new methods, make sure that you agree
with the GPLv2 terms in which this software is licensed.

INSTRUCTIONS:

You need to inform the path of a file with the information of the
method you desire to implement.
Notice that:
1) The name of the new method is given by the name of your file.
   Ex: If your file is called "myMethod.txt", your method will be
       called myMethod.
2) The file presents the parameters of the new method.
Declarations are made following the syntax:
PARAMETER_NAME:PARAMETER_TYPE = DEFAULT_VALUE

Available types are:
UINT: unsigned integer
DBL:  double (floating point/real)
BOL:  boolean
STR:  string

OBS: If the PARAMETER_TYPE is STR (string), you should list the
possible/accepted values separated by ",". The first element of
the list is considered as the default value.

Example:
NEAREST_NEIGHBORS:UINT = 20
RADIUS_COEFFICIENT:DBL = 3.15
ENABLE_OPTMIZATIONS:BOL = TRUE
CORRELATION_METRIC:STR = KENDALL,JACARD,RBO
