**NewMethod**

This script aims to facilitate the implementation of new methods in the Unsupervised Distance Learning Framework (UDLF).  

Given a file with the parameters of the new method (newMethod.txt is an example), it creates all the necessary files
and make all the fundamental changes in the software. Following the script execution, the new method can be implemented in the
files "src/MyMethod.cpp" and "src/MyMethod.cpp" which were just created.
